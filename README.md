# **Design issues in multi-arm trials**

This repository contains the main code and R functions to reproduce the results of the simulation study presented in my master thesis which has the title "Design issues in multi-arm trials".


This thesis aims to enhance the methodology for optimally utilizing different patient subgroups in the analysis of a multi-arm trial while considering different compositions of control data. It was of further interest to evaluate the analysis strategy, the randomization strategy and the distribution of the different patient populations. The results from a simulation study are presented, where the performance of the proposed approaches in terms of the type I error rate and statistical power was evaluated under a wide range of scenarios.
